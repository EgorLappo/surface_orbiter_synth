This is my final project for MUSIC 220A in 2021, in which I have built a cool new synth using `ChucK`, `p5.js`, and websockets. 

In 2022, [Sam](https://github.com/sslowe) and I have expanded this technology to create an orchestra piece for 12 computers called _Flow_, [https://github.com/sslowe/flow](https://github.com/sslowe/flow).
